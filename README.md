# Assignment-5 VG Sales Data
### Short description 
A Python module called Lab2.ipynb makes it possible to connect, access, and read data using SQL. Additionally, the file provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to read and write data to databases. This repository contains Python scripts that show you how to use pandas in combination with SQL databases for data preprocessing. The scripts that are offered include importing data from a CSV file, executing basic and advanced SQL queries, and filtering and manipulating data using pandas.
## Getting Started 
  To get started with these scripts, Python will be installed along with the required libraries (pandas & pymysql). You will also need access to a MySQL database.
### Prerequisites
 Python Notebook, Pandas, Pymysql and MySQL database
### Installing
  Clone this repository to your local machine & install the required Python libraries using pip.
## Running the Tests
 In order to run the code in Python, you will need go to the task bar and click on "Run" or you can go to cell and click on "Run All"
### Breakdown of Tests
Confirm that the CSV file can be imported into a pandasâ€™ data frame and check that the data filtering feature works properly.
## Deployment 
Not Applicable because this code will not be deployed on live data.
